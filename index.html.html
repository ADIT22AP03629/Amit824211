        <p>Determination- Bihar being an under-developed state,
             most of the people from there have seen the lowest
              standards of living. They come with the zeal and 
              determination of changing the situation as much 
              as they can.Down to earth- coming from a very 
              humble background, most of the Biharis you meet
               are deeply rooted people and modest
            Respect for their culture- they respect their 
            culture more than anyone else. We all know how
             crazy the train bookings get during Chhath. 
             That's because all the Biharis want to go back 
             to their home for the festival.</p>
